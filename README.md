# ImageElo
Python script to make a game of Elo for image folder to interactively sort your images comparing two at the time

## Don't run it on real files without backup
It will rename them and potentially break something

## Not working with weird file names and other languages (yet)
will fix soon i guess

## How to use

run script in the folder with images, or pass it as an attribute
